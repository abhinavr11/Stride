# Timeline for assignments

## Assignment 1
### Audio acuity
### Week 1
> * Learning phase (involves reading more about MobileNets and it variants watching a few tutorials as well ) [till 12-08-21]
> * Implementation in steps -
> * First to atleast come up with a basic code that could classify the current dataset
> * Wrapping first , as suggested in assignment
> * Then finally trying to reduce complexity 

### Week 2
> * Will be working on the wrapper for the model
> * Aim will be to automatically pick up and classify the numbers in the provided audio clip
> * Made a few small changes to the code to further improve the accuracy
> * Small subtle changes in CNN architecture might be needed but no compromises with the accuracy 

### Week 3
> * Tried different experiments and built a testing mechanism but things dont seem to be working
> * Will be trying out regularization
> * Made a few changes to the CNN (introduced strides so reduce overfitting on the MNIST dataset)
> * Will be following a pipeline to train on MNIST and test on freespeak dataset 
> * If the model performs well on freespeak , then will try that out on the audio file provided

### Week 4
> * Trying different combinations with regularization
> * I plan to fine tune the model on the real data once again
> * Semi Supervised or active learning might help but we have a constraint of limited real test dataset of just 67 audio clips
> * This being the last week , I'll wrap up by reducing complexity
